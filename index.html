                        <p class="pt-5"> Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. My name is Darnell and I am a
                            part-time enterpreneur. I started this business because I love helping people and
                            changing lives for the btter. I think there are two types of people those who leave
                            their personal finacial success in the hands of their empolyers, and those who take
                            full responsibility for their own personal development and finacial success.
                        </p>
                        
                        <p>It all started one day at the car wash when I found a $20 bill cleaning out vacuums.
                            Later that same day I stopped at a Circle K for gas and a homeless person opened the
                            door for me. I thanked him and gave him the $20. </p>
                        <p>As he examined the bill, his expression slowly changed. A smile gradually appeared on
                            his face and he opened his eyes wide. He was extreamly happy at this moment.
                            Although the money was not increadibly significant, every little bit helps.
                            This is the type of experience I like to recreate for my clients when I say I enjoy
                            helping people.
                        </p>




                        <p>What I mean by changing lives for the better is as follows: Your purchase will result
                            in a 10% donation to Arizona Friends of Foster Children Foundation, which aims to
                            create opportunities to build self-esteem and empower children and youth in foster
                            care by funding services to enrich their life experiences and ensure their
                            successful transitionto adulthood. Take a moment to think about the impact that
                            growing up without your parents or loved ones may have no your future success.</p>
                        <p>Yes, my full-time position is that of manager at a car wash, which is not a very
                            glamorous position . As a previous business owner, a student of leadership, and a
                            self-taught designer, my experience has enabled me to acquire highly specialized
                            skills and, although big picture thinking is not neessary or valued at my current
                            employer , I am able to contribute significantly to your organization, and what you
                            would like to communicate. As part of my serice, I will provide you with a minimum
                            of three design options that will surely solve problem & blow your mind. </p>
                        <p>There is one thing I would like to leave you with: 99% of businesses are the same,
                            whether they sell a product or provide a services. What makes a business successful
                            is it's people and their decisions.</p>

                        <h2> STRATEGIC AND CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING</h2>

                        <P>If you are seeking assistance with graphic design, logo, or website strategy, let me
                            know your objectives, what you wish to accomplish, and the impact you envisage. The
                            first design will be developed specifically as you requested with the information
                            and details that you provided. The second design eill reflect my vision based on the
                            art and science of maketing; the third design will be a combination of the two.</P>
